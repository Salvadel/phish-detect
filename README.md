# PhishDetect

A machine learning classifier that analyzes email content to determine the likelihood it is a phishing attempt. Built as an academic exploration of applying supervised learning to a real-world cybersecurity problem.
 
**Scope note:** This is a proof-of-concept project built for educational purposes. It is not intended for production use or as a replacement for enterprise security tools.

## What It Does

PhishDetect takes a pasted email, extracts a set of features (URLs, sender analysis, keyword signals), and runs them through a trained Random Forest classifier. It returns a confidence percentage and a verdict: **PHISHING**, **UNCERTAIN**, or **LEGITIMATE**.

## How to Run

No Python installation required. Download the pre-built executable for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/phish-detect/releases/latest) tab.

| Operating System | File to download |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Windows | `PhishDetect.exe` |
| Mac / Linux | `PhishDetect` |

### Windows

1. Download `PhishDetect.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/phish-detect/releases/latest) tab
2. Double-click `PhishDetect.exe` to run

### Mac / Linux

1. Download `PhishDetect` from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/phish-detect/releases/latest) tab
2. Open a terminal in the download folder and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x PhishDetect
./PhishDetect
```

> **Note:** On Mac, if you see a security warning, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

## Example Output

```
=== PhishDetect ===
Paste email content below (type END on a new line when done):

...

Analyzing email...

Top signals detected:
  · Sender domain mismatch
  · Urgency keywords found in body
  · Suspicious URL flagged by VirusTotal

Confidence: 87% — Verdict: PHISHING
```

## Limitations

As a proof of concept, PhishDetect has known limitations:

- Trained on a small dataset — accuracy may degrade on unusual phishing styles
- VirusTotal API requires an internet connection and a free API key
- Not tested against adversarial inputs or obfuscated phishing content
- Copy-paste only — does not parse .eml files or connect to email clients
